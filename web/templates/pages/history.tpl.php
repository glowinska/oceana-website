<h2>History</h2>

<h3>When was it established?</h3>
<p>Oceana was established in 2001 by an international group of leading foundations including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Sandler Foundation, and The Pew Charitable Trusts. This followed a 1999 study they commissioned, which found that less than .5% of all resources spent by U.S. environmental nonprofit groups were used for ocean conservation.</p>
<h3>What happened in 2001?</h3>
<p>In 2001, Oceana absorbed The Ocean Law Project, which was also created by The Pew Charitable Trusts, for Oceana's legal branch. In 2002, American Oceans Campaign, founded by actor and environmentalist Ted Danson, merged with Oceana to further their common goals of ocean conservation.</p>
<h3>What is Oceana Canada?</h3>
<p>In 2015, Oceana Canada was established as a legally distinct non-profit organization. It works in collaboration with Oceana, inc. and is considered part of the larger charity. Except under very specific circumstances, Canadian charity law does not grant either legal charity status or the ability to issue tax exempt receipts to Canadian offices of non-Candadian nonprofits, making it much more benficial to create an independent, Canadian charity.</p>
