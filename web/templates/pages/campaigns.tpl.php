<h2>Current campaigns</h2>

<h3>Responsible fishing</h3>
<p>Concerned about declining fish catches since 1980, Oceana is committed to combating overfishing and restoring the world's fisheries. It mainly focuses on legislation for scientific based catch limits, which have led to dramatic recoveries of depleted fisheries in the recent past. It also opposes fishing subsidies, which it argues are (in their current form) contributing to overfishing. Oceana also focuses on reducing bycatch, especially of protected or endangered species.</p>
<p>Oceana's main focus with sustainable fishing is providing clean, plentiful food. They often cite the lack of emissions or resources, like land or fresh water, that wild fish require, and that this lack of pollution or resources would be necessary to feed the world's growing population. This campaign is called "Save the Oceans, Feed the World."</p>
<h3>Plastics</h3>
<p>Oceana focuses on curbing or entirely eliminating the use of plastics, especially single use plastics due to their harmful impact on marine ecosystem and on human consumers. The organization generally opposes focusing on recycling or cleanup, and it says this is due to inefficiencies of recycling that large amounts of plastics in the ocean.</p>
<h3>Seafood fraud</h3>
<p>Oceana has led the way on exposing and advocating against seafood fraud. Its opposition comes from the widespread nature of this problem, the negative health impact mislabeled fish can have (especially to people with certain seafood allergies) and their impact on overfishing by obscuring its impact.</p>
<h3>Climate and energy</h3>
<p>Oceana is dedicated to combating the numerous threats to the world's oceans that climate change imposes. Its main focus has been the acidification of the ocean, which threatens marine life, especially shellfish and coral that are necessary to many marine ecosystems, and, consequently, sources of seafood.</p>
